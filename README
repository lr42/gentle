Gentle Break Reminder
========================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------

About the status
========================================================================

This project is currently in beta, so it may be a little rough around
the edges, but many improvements will be coming in the very near future.


What is this?
========================================================================

Gentle Break Reminder is a program which will remind you to take regular
breaks, in a very gentle way.

When it's getting close to time to take a break, a colorful, pulsing box
will appear on your screen.  You can move this by dragging it to
wherever you want on the screen, and resize it by draggin the top-left
corner.

When it's time to take a short break (indicated by the box pulsing
green), you can click on the box and a full screen window will appear
for 20 seconds reminding you to look away from your screen.  (This
generally follows the 20-20-20 rule:  At least every 20 minutes, look at
something 20 meters away or more, for at least 20 seconds.

When it's time to take a regular break (indicated by the box pulsing
blue), clicking on the box will bring up a five-minute timer, during
which time you should get away from your computer for a bit.  When you
are done with your break, click on the "Let me get back to work" button
at the bottom of the screen to reset the break timers and continue using
your computer.


Installation
========================================================================

**Note**:  The current installation process is temporary and will be
improved in future versions.

Run the following commands in your terminal:

1. Go to a directory where you'd like to install Gentle Break Reminder.

2. Clone the project:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lr42/gentle

3. Set up a virtual environment to install the dependencies of the
  project:

    cd gentle
    python3 -m venv --prompt . venv
    source ./venv/bin/activate

4. Install the dependecies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the program:

    python3 gentle.py

An icon will appear in your taskbar, indicating that Gentle Break
Reminder is running.  In about every 12 minutes, a colorful box will pop
up on the screen reminding you to take either a short break (to look
away from the screen) or a long break, to get away from the computer and
strech your legs.  (The times and breaks will be customizable in the
very near future.)
